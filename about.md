# About {{site.title}}
A collection of write-ups and research on real-world security issues. It does not feature general security topics or CTFs, but rather more peculiar cases, incidents, bug bounties and research, which hopefully will grow in time.\
It is named after a ridiculous error message returned from a bug bounty target, in the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">"all your base are belong to us"</a>:
